### Hi there, I'm David Precopia

An Android Software Developer who has a passion for writing programs that are clean, testable, and modular. I primarily write apps in Kotlin, with extensive experience with Java and SQL as well.

- ðŸª£ My [BitBucket profile](https://bitbucket.org/davidprecopia/) is where you can find projects I've used to teach the paradigms of clean architecture to others.
- ðŸ“š On the side I'm teaching myself ðŸ“± iOS/macOS development, ðŸ’» NodeJS, and a wide variety of personal projects.
- ðŸ“± My (current) personal magnum opuses are my two Android apps, [Lists](https://github.com/DavidPrecopia/Lists) and [RxTracker](https://github.com/DavidPrecopia/RxTracker).
